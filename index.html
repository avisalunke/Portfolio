                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>I am Avinash Salunke, a dedicated software professional with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune. My career has been marked by a blend of technical expertise and leadership experience.

                            Currently, I serve as a Team Lead at GreenCall Technologies Pvt. Ltd., where I lead a team of auditors to ensure the accuracy and completeness of survey data. My role involves developing and implementing auditing processes, providing training, and fostering a collaborative team environment to enhance performance.
                            
                            Prior to this, I was a Team Lead at TDS Group Pvt. Ltd., supervising a team of call agents to maintain quality communication and customer service. My responsibilities included monitoring performance, conducting training sessions, and managing resource allocation.
                            
                            My technical skills include proficiency in Java, Python, JavaScript, and web technologies like JSP and Servlet. I have experience with frameworks such as Spring Boot and Spring Security, and I am adept at working with databases including SQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.
                            
                            I have also contributed as a Java Developer at Mass Technologies, where I was involved in designing, developing, and testing Java-based software solutions. Additionally, my role as a Customer Support Executive at Osmose Pvt. Ltd. helped me develop strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills.
                            
                            My academic projects reflect my capability in software development and data analytics. These include the development of a secure keyword search and data sharing mechanism for cloud computing and a smart waste management system that optimizes collection routes based on data analysis.
                            
                            With completed coursework in problem-solving, object-oriented programming, database management, data structures, and big data analytics, I am now seeking a challenging opportunity to leverage my skills in a dynamic environment, contributing to innovative projects and driving organizational success.</p>
